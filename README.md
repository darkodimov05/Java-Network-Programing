# Java-Network-Programing

Creating Java Chat application with UDP protocol. In Java, UDP communication is implemented with the class DatagramSocket. With this class you have a client and a server. In fact UDP communication is connection-less protocol, this mean that if one client send a packet, we are not sure that this packet is arrived on the other side.

This is Chat application between two sides. I have created two ports, one for receiving and the other one is for sending the packets.
